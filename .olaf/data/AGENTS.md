**DO NOT CREATE SUMMARY DOCUMENTS** unless explicitly requested:

- Only create documentation when the user specifically asks for it

## Code Style

- Write minimal code that solves the problem
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Communication

- Be concise - use as few words as possible
- Status updates: single line max
- No lengthy explanations unless asked
