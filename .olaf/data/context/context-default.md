### Documentation Policy
**CRITICAL - DO NOT CREATE SUMMARY DOCUMENTS**:
- **NEVER** create markdown files to summarize work unless explicitly requested
- **NEVER** create documentation files like "CHANGES.md", "SUMMARY.md", "WORK_COMPLETED.md" etc.
- User finds unsolicited summary documents annoying and wasteful
- Only create documentation when user specifically asks for it
- Focus on doing the work, not documenting that you did the work
