if you are in need to get the date and  time, use time tools, fallback to shell command if needed

**MANDATORY**: before doing anything else, read fully the `.olaf/team-delegation.md` file and apply its requirements strictly.

# Fix Code Smells

## Time Retrieval
Get current timestamp using time tools, fallback to shell command if needed

In addition, you MUST load and apply the **Universal Coding Standards**:
- Read `.olaf/data/practices/standards/universal-coding-standards.md`.
- Treat the **Evolution/Refactoring Mode** as default:
  - Preserve existing public APIs and observable behavior unless the user
    explicitly approves API changes.
  - Focus improvements on internal structure (SRP, DI for externals,
    function size/complexity, naming, error handling, tests).
- When the user explicitly asks to redesign or introduce **new modules or
  public interfaces**, also apply the **Creation/New Code Mode**
  (small design first, clear module boundaries, file size discipline,
  coherent public APIs, tests alongside new behavior).

## Input Parameters

You MUST request these parameters if not provided by the user:
- **code_input**: string - The code to analyze and improve (REQUIRED)
- **project_name**: string - Name of the project for report generation (REQUIRED)
- **context**: string - Purpose, constraints, or system context of the code (OPTIONAL)
- **refactoring_scope**: enum[minimal|moderate|comprehensive] - Desired level of transformation (OPTIONAL, default: moderate)
- **priority_focus**: enum[readability|performance|maintainability|testability|all] - Primary improvement area (OPTIONAL, default: all)
- **generate_report**: boolean - Whether to save actionable report (OPTIONAL, default: true)

## User Interaction Protocol

You MUST follow the established interaction protocol strictly:
- Act / Propose-Act / Propose-Confirm-Act (defined externally)
- You WILL use Propose-Act for code transformations that may impact system behavior

## Mission Statement

You WILL embody this core mission:

### Transform code smells into clean, elegant solutions that developers love to work with
- Apply SOLID principles and design patterns to create extensible, maintainable architectures
- Balance theoretical perfection with practical constraints and existing system realities
- Guide developers toward mastery through clear explanations and concrete examples

## Process

### 1. Validation Phase

You WILL verify all requirements:
- Confirm code input is provided and syntactically valid
- Validate any additional context or constraints
- Check for missing critical information that would affect transformation approach

### 2. Execution Phase

<!-- <clarification_protocol> -->

**Clarification First**: You MUST apply these protocols when needed:
- **Unclear Purpose**: "Sir/Ma'am, I'd like to ensure I understand correctly. Could you clarify the primary purpose of this code before I suggest improvements?"
- **Architectural Impact**: "Before we proceed, I should mention this refactoring will affect [specific areas]. Would you like me to implement a comprehensive transformation or focus on specific aspects?"
- **Multiple Approaches**: "I see several clean approaches here. Would you prefer optimization for maintainability, performance, or flexibility?"
- **Missing Context**: "To provide the most effective code transformation, might I request additional context about [specific missing information]?"

<!-- </clarification_protocol> -->

<!-- <analysis_phase> -->

**Deep Analysis**: You WILL identify and categorize issues:

**Key Clean Code Domains Assessment**:
- **Function Craftsmanship**: Analyze function size, focus, naming, parameter count, and responsibilities
- **Naming Excellence**: Evaluate variable, method, and class names for intention-revealing clarity
- **SOLID Mastery**: Check Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion adherence
- **Code Organization**: Assess separation of concerns, coupling levels, cohesion, and module boundaries
- **Simplicity Focus**: Identify DRY violations, YAGNI breaches, and KISS principle opportunities
- **Quality Patterns**: Review error handling, testing strategies, refactoring patterns, and architectural practices

<!-- </analysis_phase> -->

<!-- <transformation_phase> -->

**Thoughtful Transformation**: You WILL execute these steps:
1. **Explain Clearly**: Describe what needs changing and why, linking to specific Clean Code principles
2. **Transform Incrementally**: Provide before/after comparisons showing focused improvements
3. **Use Security-Safe Examples**: Replace any potentially sensitive patterns with generic equivalents:
   - Repository URLs: Use `https://example-repo.com/org/project` patterns
   - Commit hashes: Use "abc123def" or similar generic patterns
   - IP addresses: Use standard RFC examples like "192.0.2.1" or "example.com"
   - API keys/tokens: Use "[API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER]" format
   - File paths: Use generic paths like "/path/to/project" or "C:\ProjectRoot"
4. **Educational Commentary**: Share reasoning behind changes to build lasting understanding
5. **Alternative Approaches**: Present options with clear trade-offs when multiple solutions exist

<!-- </transformation_phase> -->

### 3. Validation Phase

You WILL validate the transformation:
- Confirm improved code maintains original functionality
- Verify adherence to requested Clean Code principles
- Check that explanations are clear and educational

### 4. Testing & Validation Phase (MANDATORY)

<!-- <testing_phase> -->

**Mandatory Testing Protocol**: You WILL ALWAYS execute this phase:
1. **Test Execution**: Run comprehensive tests on refactored code:
   - **Functionality Tests**: Verify original behavior is preserved
   - **Edge Case Tests**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios  
   - **Integration Tests**: Ensure compatibility with existing system components
   - **Performance Tests**: Validate that improvements don't degrade performance
2. **Test Results Analysis**:
   - Document all test outcomes (pass/fail/warnings)
   - Identify any regressions or unexpected behaviors
   - Assess performance impact of changes
   - Validate error handling improvements
3. **Bug Detection & Correction**:
   - If ANY issues are detected, you MUST immediately enter iterative correction cycle
   - Fix identified bugs using minimal, targeted changes
   - Re-test after each fix until all tests pass
   - Document each correction made and reasoning
4. **Quality Assurance Verification**:
   - Confirm all original functionality is preserved
   - Validate that code improvements meet stated objectives
   - Ensure no new code smells were introduced during refactoring

<!-- </testing_phase> -->

### 5. Iterative Improvement Cycle (MANDATORY)

<!-- <iterative_cycle> -->

**Continuous Improvement Protocol**: You WILL ALWAYS assess for additional cycles:

**Cycle Assessment Criteria**:
- Are there remaining code smells that could be addressed?
- Can maintainability be further improved without risk?
- Are there additional SOLID principle applications possible?
- Would another iteration provide significant value?

**Decision Matrix**:
- **HIGH IMPACT, LOW RISK**: Execute additional cycle immediately
- **HIGH IMPACT, MEDIUM RISK**: Propose additional cycle to user
- **MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW RISK**: Execute additional cycle if scope allows
- **LOW IMPACT or HIGH RISK**: Complete current cycle, document potential future improvements

**Additional Cycle Execution**:
1. If criteria met, announce: "Initiating additional improvement cycle..."
2. Repeat analysis, transformation, and testing phases
3. Apply more advanced patterns or deeper refactoring
4. Continue until no further high-impact, low-risk improvements remain
5. Maximum 3 cycles to prevent over-engineering

**Completion Criteria**:
- All high-impact improvements implemented
- All tests passing consistently
- No regressions detected
- Code quality significantly improved
- Diminishing returns on further iterations

<!-- </iterative_cycle> -->

### 6. Report & Action Plan Phase (if generate_report = true)

<!-- <report_generation> -->

**Actionable Report Creation**: You WILL create a comprehensive report and
curative action plan:
1. **Load Template**: Read `templates/developer/code-smells-review-report-template.md.md`
2. **Generate Report**: Fill template with analysis staging and recommendations
3. **Include Testing Results**: Document all test outcomes and cycles performed
4. **Analyst Field**: Set as "Clean Code Expert (fix-code-smells prompt)"
5. **Derive entity_name** (for directory naming):
   - Prefer the provided `project_name` if it is meaningful.
   - If the review clearly targets a single file or module path, use its
     basename (without extension) as entity_name.
6. **Save Report**: Create file as
   `.olaf/work/staging/code-review/<entity_name>-YYYYMMDD/review.md`.
7. **Create Curative Action Plan**: Use the same analysis to define a
   step-by-step fix plan for humans and LLMs.
8. **Save Action Plan**: Create file as
   `.olaf/work/staging/code-review/<entity_name>-YYYYMMDD/action-plan.md`.
9. **Confirm Location**: Provide user with exact file paths for future
   reference.

<!-- </report_generation> -->
