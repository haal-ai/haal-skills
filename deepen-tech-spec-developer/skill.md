**MANDATORY**: before doing anything else, read fully the `.olaf/team-delegation.md` file and apply its requirements strictly.

## Input Parameters

You MUST request these parameters if not provided by the user:
- **tech_spec_path**: string - Path to the existing technical specification file (REQUIRED)
- **application_name**: string - Name of the application for file naming (REQUIRED)
- **chapter_focus**: string - Specific chapter to start with, defaults to first chapter (OPTIONAL)

## User Interaction Protocol

You MUST follow the established interaction protocol strictly:
- Act / Propose-Act / Propose-Confirm-Act (defined externally)
- You WILL use Propose-Confirm-Act for this competency due to high complexity and session management requirements

## Chapter Structure - Developer Focus

The deep-dive documentation will be organized into developer-focused chapters with evidence-based assessment:
1. **Architecture & Design Patterns Assessment** - Design pattern usage, SOLID principles adherence, component coupling analysis
2. **API Implementation Quality Analysis** - Endpoint implementation, error handling patterns, validation strategies, REST compliance
3. **Data Access & Transaction Management** - ORM patterns, transaction boundaries, connection management, query optimization
4. **Error Handling & Exception Strategy** - Exception hierarchy evaluation, logging patterns, debugging capabilities
5. **Unit Testing & Code Quality Evaluation** - Test coverage analysis, test quality assessment, mocking patterns, TDD practices
6. **Module Dependencies & Structure Assessment** - Dependency injection evaluation, module boundaries, coupling analysis, monorepo structure

## Prerequisites

You MUST verify these requirements before proceeding:
1. You WILL confirm the tech spec file exists and is accessible
2. You MUST validate that the application name follows kebab-case naming
3. You WILL check for existing chapter files to avoid overwrites

## Process

### 1. Validation Phase

You WILL verify all requirements:
- Confirm tech_spec_path exists and is readable
- Validate application_name is provided and properly formatted
- Check chapter_focus parameter if provided matches available chapters
- Verify access to staging directory for file creation
- Scan for existing chapter files to prevent conflicts

### 2. Execution Phase

**Tech Spec Analysis:**

<!-- <tech_spec_analysis> -->

You MUST read and analyze the existing technical specification at `tech_spec_path`

You WILL extract: application architecture, key components, technology stack, security features, deployment details

<!-- </tech_spec_analysis> -->

**Chapter Planning:**

<!-- <chapter_planning> -->

You WILL create a comprehensive chapter outline covering all 8 defined areas

You MUST present the chapter structure to user for approval before proceeding

<!-- </chapter_planning> -->

**Core Logic**: You WILL execute following protocol requirements
- Apply Propose-Confirm-Act protocol for chapter structure approval
- Execute chapter development cycle for each approved chapter:
  1. **Deep Analysis**: Extract detailed technical information from codebase
  2. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive chapter with examples and best practices  
  3. **User Review**: Present completed chapter and request feedback
  4. **Session Management**: Offer session transition after each chapter completion

**Session Transition Management:**
- Execute carry-over competency when user requests new session
- Include current progress state and next chapter information
- Provide clear instructions for session resumption

### 3. Validation Phase

You WILL validate results:
- Confirm chapter documentation meets quality standards
- Verify all code examples are accurate and functional
- Validate file naming conventions are followed

- **Coupling Analysis**: Inter-module dependencies, circular dependency detection
- **Configuration Management**: Application properties organization, environment-specific configuration
- **Build Process Assessment**: Build tool configuration, dependency management, build performance

## Output Format

You WILL generate outputs following this structure:
- Primary deliverable: Follow template structure below for each chapter
- Supporting files: `.olaf/work/staging/specs/deep-dive-{application_name}-chapter-{N}-{chapter-name}-YYYYMMDD-NNN.md`
- Documentation: Complete chapter with code examples and implementation details

**File Naming Convention**:
- {application_name} is kebab-case formatted
- {N} is chapter number (01, 02, etc.)  
- {chapter-name} is kebab-case chapter name
- YYYYMMDD-NNN follows standard OLAF naming

**Chapter Template Structure**:

```markdown

## User Interaction Protocol

### After Each Chapter:
1. Present the completed chapter to the user
2. Ask: "Please review Chapter {N}: {Chapter Title}. Are you satisfied with the depth and detail?"
3. If user requests changes, make adjustments and repeat review
4. Once approved, ask: "Would you like to continue with the next chapter in a new session? This helps manage memory and ensures optimal performance."
5. If user says yes:
   - Execute carry-over competency
   - Tell user: "I've created a carry-over note. Please start your next session with 'carry-on' to continue with Chapter {N+1}: {Next Chapter Title}"
6. If user says no, continue with next chapter in current session

## Session State Management

### Carry-Over Information to Include:
