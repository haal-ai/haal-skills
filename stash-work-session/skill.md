<olaf>

if you are in need to get the date and  time, use time tools, fallback to shell command if needed

**MANDATORY**: before doing anything else, read fully the `.olaf/team-delegation.md` file and apply its requirements strictly.

## Purpose

Create a complete work stash that preserves both context documentation AND all unstaged files in a dedicated folder structure for seamless restoration in future sessions.

## Context
- User wants to pause current work and start something new
- Need to preserve actual working files, not just documentation
- Should enable complete restoration of work environment
- Files should be organized in timestamped folders for easy selection

## Instructions

### 1. Git Status Analysis & File Collection
- **First**: Run `git status` to identify all unstaged and untracked files
- **Collect**: All modified, added, deleted, and untracked files
- **Note**: Staged files (user may want to commit first)
- **Capture**: Current branch, git state, and working directory

### 2. Create Stash Directory Structure

Create stash folder with format: `olaf-stashes/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-<subject>/`

**Subject Extraction Rules:**
- Use main topic/feature being worked on  
- Keep to 2-3 words maximum
- Use kebab-case format
- Examples: "olaf-framework", "api-integration", "ui-components"
**Directory Structure:**

```

olaf-stashes/

├── 20251031-0845-api-integration/

│   ├── _stash-context.md          # Documentation

│   ├── src/                       # Copied unstaged files

│   ├── config/                    # Preserving structure

│   └── ...                        # All modified files

```

### 3. File Preservation Process
- **Create** stash directory: `olaf-stashes/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-<subject>/`
- **Copy** all unstaged files maintaining directory structure
- **Copy** all untracked files maintaining directory structure  
- **Create** `_stash-context.md` with work documentation
- **Record** file mapping and git state
**Stash Context Documentation:**

```

# STASH CONTEXT - <timestamp>

==============================

## Work Transition Notice:

🔄 **CURRENT WORK PAUSED** - Moving to new work session

📋 **STASH REASON**: [Brief reason for stashing]

📁 **STASH LOCATION**: olaf-stashes/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-<subject>/

## Files Preserved:

### Unstaged Files:

[List of copied modified files]

### Untracked Files: 

[List of copied new files]

### Git State:
- Branch: [current branch]
- Staged files: [if any]
- Last commit: [commit hash]

## Current State & What We Did:

[Detailed summary of work completed]

## What's Expected Next:

[Pending tasks and next steps]

## Restoration Commands:
1. Navigate to: olaf-stashes/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-<subject>/
2. Use stash-restart-session to restore files
3. Continue with: [specific next steps]

## Transition Notes:

✅ Files preserved in stash directory

✅ Work context documented  

🚀 Ready for new work session

```

### 4. File Management & Git Hygiene
- Create `olaf-stashes/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Preserve exact directory structure in stash folder
- Add `olaf-stashes/` to `.gitignore` if not present
- Keep original files untouched (copy, don't move)

### 5. Session Transition Message  

After creating stash directory and copying files:
- Confirm files have been preserved in stash directory
- Show stash location and file count
- State readiness for new work  
- Provide clear restoration instructions

## Output Format
1. **Analyze** git status and identify files to preserve2. **Create** stash directory: `olaf-stashes/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-<subject>/`
3. **Copy** all unstaged/untracked files maintaining structure4. **Create** `_stash-context.md` documentation
5. **Confirm** stash creation with directory path and file count6. **Provide** transition message and restoration guidance
7. **Ask** what new work to begin

## Technical Implementation

### Python Stash Manager Tool

The stash system uses a dedicated Python tool for cross-platform reliability:

**Location**: `tools/stash_manager.py`

### Create Stash Command

```bash

python tools/stash_manager.py create <subject> --reason "Optional reason"

```

**Example:**

```bash

python tools/stash_manager.py create "api-integration" --reason "Pausing to work on docs"

```

### Key Features
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS
- ✅ **Git integration**: Automatically detects unstaged/untracked files
- ✅ **Structure preservation**: Maintains exact directory structure
- ✅ **Metadata tracking**: JSON + Markdown context files
- ✅ **Git ignore**: Automatically adds olaf-stashes/ to .gitignore
- ✅ **Clean interface**: Simple command-line tool

### Implementation Benefits
- **No complex shell commands** in competency files
- **Consistent behavior** across all platforms  
- **Easy maintenance** and testing
- **Proper error handling** with Python exceptions
- **Extensible design** for future enhancements

## Success Criteria
- ✅ **Complete File Preservation**: All unstaged/untracked files copied to stash directory
- ✅ **Structure Maintained**: Directory tree preserved exactly  
- ✅ **Context Documented**: Clear work summary and restoration steps
- ✅ **Easy Discovery**: Stash named with timestamp and subject for easy identification
- ✅ **Restoration Ready**: Files ready for seamless restoration via stash-restart-session
- ✅ **Git Hygiene**: Stash directory properly ignored by git
