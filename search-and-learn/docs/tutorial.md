# Search and Learn: Step-by-Step Tutorial

## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through using the Search and Learn skill to systematically research topics, acquire knowledge, and apply your learning in practical contexts. By following this structured approach, you'll efficiently gather information, synthesize insights, and create actionable outcomes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] Clear idea of what you want to learn
- [ ] Understanding of your current knowledge level
- [ ] Defined context for how you'll apply the learning
- [ ] Access to web search capabilities
- [ ] Time allocated for the complete 8-task workflow

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Learning Parameters

Before invoking the skill, define three key inputs:

**Learning Objective** - Be specific about what you want to learn:
- ❌ "Learn about AI"
- ✅ "Understand how to implement basic neural networks in Python for image classification"

**Current Knowledge** - Honestly assess your starting point:
- Example: "I know Python basics and some machine learning concepts, but never implemented neural networks"

**Application Context** - Define practical constraints:
- Example: "Need to build a prototype for work presentation next week, using TensorFlow or PyTorch"

### Step 2: Invoke the Skill

Start the search-and-learn workflow:

```
Use the search-and-learn skill
```

The skill will guide you through collecting your parameters interactively.

### Step 3: Complete the Task Chain

The skill executes 8 sequential tasks:

| Task | Purpose | Your Role |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1. Collect Parameters | Gather your learning inputs | Provide clear, specific answers |
| 2. Validate Prerequisites | Check readiness | Confirm or address gaps |
| 3. Define Learning Goals | Create measurable objectives | Review and refine goals |
| 4. Develop Search Strategy | Plan information gathering | Approve search approach |
| 5. Execute Systematic Search | Find and document sources | Monitor progress |
| 6. Evaluate and Synthesize | Organize findings | Review synthesized knowledge |
| 7. Apply and Test Learning | Validate understanding | Engage with exercises |
| 8. Generate Learning Report | Create final documentation | Review and save report |

### Step 4: Review Your Learning Report

Your final report should include:

- [ ] Clear learning summary with key concepts
- [ ] Credible sources with full URLs
- [ ] Practical examples you can implement
- [ ] Identified knowledge gaps
- [ ] Actionable next steps
- [ ] Concept relationship map

### Step 5: Apply Your Learning

Take action on the report:

1. Implement the practical applications identified
2. Address knowledge gaps with follow-up research
3. Save the report for future reference
4. Share insights with your team if applicable

## Verification Checklist

After completing the workflow, verify:

- [ ] All 8 tasks completed successfully
- [ ] Learning goals have measurable success criteria
- [ ] Sources are credible and URLs are valid
- [ ] Synthesized knowledge is organized by topic
- [ ] Practical applications are actionable
- [ ] Knowledge gaps are clearly identified
- [ ] Report file is saved and accessible

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Task chain stops unexpectedly
**Cause**: Missing dependency or context variable
**Solution**: Check the error message for required context, restart from the failed task

### Issue: No relevant sources found
**Cause**: Search queries too specific or poorly formatted
**Solution**: Broaden search scope, use alternative terminology, adjust search strategy

### Issue: Conflicting information from sources
**Cause**: Different perspectives or outdated information
**Solution**: Document conflicts, prioritize authoritative sources, note publication dates

### Issue: Can't validate learning practically
**Cause**: Lack of application opportunities
**Solution**: Create simplified test scenarios, use online sandboxes or simulations

### Issue: Report is too long or unfocused
**Cause**: Scope creep during research
**Solution**: Return to original learning objective, consider splitting into multiple sessions

## Next Steps

After completing your first search-and-learn session:

1. **Iterate on gaps**: Use the identified knowledge gaps for follow-up sessions
2. **Build knowledge network**: Link related reports together
3. **Create templates**: Develop personal learning templates for recurring topics
4. **Share methodology**: Use `create-prompt` to share your research approach
