# Review Document for Jargon

## Overview

This skill reviews documents for jargon, idioms, and unclear terminology, then suggests plain language alternatives. It helps make content more accessible to diverse audiences who may not share the same cultural or professional background.

## What It Catches

- **Sports jargon**: "punt", "home run", "slam dunk", "move the goalposts"
- **Corporate speak**: "synergy", "leverage", "circle back", "low-hanging fruit"
- **Military terms**: "boots on the ground", "mission-critical"
- **Regional idioms**: Expressions that don't translate globally
- **Undefined acronyms**: TLA without explanation

## When to Use

- Before publishing documentation for international audiences
- When writing for non-specialist readers
- During content accessibility reviews
- When onboarding materials need to be clearer

## Output

1. A table of all jargon found with plain alternatives
2. A summary of issues by category
3. A revised document with changes highlighted
