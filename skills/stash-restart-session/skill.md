if you are in need to get the date and  time, use time tools, fallback to shell command if needed

## Time Retrieval
Use this common helper only when saving a file or creating a folder that embeds a timestamp in its name: `skills/time-retrieval/prompts/time-retrieval.md`. Do not prompt for time when merely reading or loading files.

## Purpose

Scan the olaf-stashes directory for preserved work sessions and enable seamless restoration of files and context to resume work where it was left off. Includes pre-restoration git status check with OLAF commit thread integration to handle uncommitted changes safely.

## Context
- User wants to resume previously stashed work with actual files
- Must check for uncommitted changes before stash restoration to prevent data loss
- Should offer OLAF commit thread integration for safe handling of current work
- Need to identify available work stashes with preserved file states
- Should restore complete working environment, not just documentation
- Present numbered options for easy selection

## Instructions

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: PYTHON SCRIPT MANDATORY FOR ALL STASH OPERATIONS

**ALL stash operations MUST use the Python stash manager script:**
- `python tools/stash_manager.py list`
- `python tools/stash_manager.py conflicts <stash-name>`  
- `python tools/stash_manager.py restore <stash-name> [--backup|--force]`
**❌ NEVER use manual file operations, directory scanning, or timestamp comparison**

### 0. Pre-Restoration Git Status Check 

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Before any stash operations, check for uncommitted changes:
- **Double Git Status Check**: Run TWO different commands to ensure reliable detection
- **Uncommitted Files Detection**: If any files are found (staged or unstaged changes)
- **Present Commit Option**: Offer user the OLAF commit thread competency before proceeding
**Git Status Analysis (Double-Check Protocol):**

```bash

# First check: machine-readable format

git status --porcelain

# Second check: alternative short format (verification)

git status --short

```

**Why Double-Check is Critical:**
- Tool execution timing issues can cause first command to return empty results
- Two different git status formats provide cross-validation
- Prevents false "clean" status when changes actually exist
- Ensures reliable detection before proceeding with stash operations
**If uncommitted files found:**

```

✅ DOUBLE-CHECK CONFIRMED: Uncommitted changes detected

Both --porcelain and --short show:

• [N] staged files

• [N] unstaged modifications  

• [N] untracked files

• [N] files with both staged + unstaged changes

⚠️  UNCOMMITTED CHANGES DETECTED

🔧 RECOMMENDED ACTION: Commit current changes before restoring stash

Options:
1. 🚀 Launch OLAF commit thread to organize and commit changes
2. 📋 Show detailed git status and continue anyway
3. 🛑 Cancel stash restoration (recommended if unsure)

Would you like me to launch the OLAF commit thread? (y/N)

```

**OLAF Commit Thread Integration:**
- If user selects option 1, launch: `olaf propose commit thread`
- Wait for commit completion before proceeding with stash restoration
- After commits complete, recheck git status to ensure clean state
- Proceed with stash restoration only after clean git state confirmed
**Benefits of Pre-Commit Check:**
- ✅ **Prevents Data Loss**: Current work preserved before stash restoration
- ✅ **Clean Git History**: Separates current changes from restored stash
- ✅ **User Control**: Explicit choice to commit or proceed with uncommitted changes
- ✅ **Workflow Integration**: Seamless handoff to OLAF commit competency

### 1. Scan Stash Directories - USE PYTHON SCRIPT ONLY

**MANDATORY**: Use the Python stash manager script for all stash operations:

```bash

python tools/stash_manager.py list

```

**DO NOT**:
- Manually scan `olaf-stashes/` directory
- Use `list_dir` or file system commands
- Parse directory names manually
- Count files manually

The Python script handles:
- Directory discovery and validation
- Timestamp extraction and formatting
- File counting and analysis
- Context loading from `_stash-context.md`
- Proper error handling and cross-platform support

### 3. Present Numbered Options  

Create a structured, numbered list for easy selection:

**Format:**

```

## 🔄 Available Work Stashes:
1. **[Subject]** - [Date/Time]

📁 Directory: olaf-stashes/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-subject/

📄 Files: [count] files preserved

📝 Summary: [Brief description of work]

🎯 Next: [What's expected next]
2. **[Subject]** - [Date/Time] 

📁 Directory: olaf-stashes/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-subject/

📄 Files: [count] files preserved

📝 Summary: [Brief description of work]  

🎯 Next: [What's expected next]

---

Select number (1-N) or 'fresh' for new work

```

### 4. User Selection & Confirmation
- Present numbered options (1-N) for easy selection
- Include 'fresh' option to start new work instead
- Wait for user's numbered choice
- Validate selection and confirm before proceeding

### 5. Pre-Restoration Conflict Detection - USE PYTHON SCRIPT ONLY

**MANDATORY**: Use the Python stash manager script for conflict detection:

```bash

python tools/stash_manager.py conflicts <stash-name>

```

**DO NOT**:
- Manually scan stash directory files
- Use file system commands to check file existence
- Compare timestamps manually
- Use `read_file` or other manual checking methods

The Python script handles:
- Cross-platform timestamp comparison
- Reliable conflict detection logic  
- Proper file existence checking
- Clear conflict reporting with detailed information
**Conflict Resolution Options:**

```

⚠️ CONFLICT DETECTED: Files with newer modifications found

Conflicting Files:

❌ src/api/handler.js - Current: 2025-10-31 09:15, Stash: 2025-10-31 08:45 

❌ config/app.json - Current: 2025-10-31 09:30, Stash: 2025-10-31 08:50

Options:
1. 🛑 Cancel restoration (recommended)
2. 📁 Backup current files first, then restore
3. 🔍 Show detailed diff for each conflict  
4. ⚡ Force overwrite (DANGEROUS - will lose current changes)

Select option (1-4):

```

### 6. Safe File Restoration Process - USE PYTHON SCRIPT ONLY

**MANDATORY**: Use the Python stash manager script for restoration:

```bash

# Safe restore (no conflicts)

python tools/stash_manager.py restore <stash-name>

# With backup (conflicts handled)  

python tools/stash_manager.py restore <stash-name> --backup

# Force restore (user accepts risk)

python tools/stash_manager.py restore <stash-name> --force

```

**DO NOT**:
- Manually copy files from stash directory
- Use file system commands for restoration
- Handle backups manually
- Parse context files manually

The Python script handles:
- Safe file copying with error handling
- Automatic backup creation when requested
- Context loading and presentation
- Cross-platform file operations
- Proper restoration reporting

### 7. Post-Restoration Setup
- **Restoration Summary**: Report files restored, conflicts resolved, backups created
- **Git Status**: Show current git state after restoration  
- **Context Load**: Present work summary and accomplishments from `_stash-context.md`
- **Backup Locations**: If backups were created, provide their locations
- **Next Steps**: Clear action items from stash context
- **Conflict Resolution**: If conflicts occurred, remind user of resolution chosen
- **Confirmation**: Ask user to confirm readiness to continue work

## Directory Identification Rules

**Primary Stash Directories:**
- **Pattern**: `olaf-stashes/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-<subject>/`
- **Contents**: Preserved files + `_stash-context.md`
- **Structure**: Original directory tree maintained
**Legacy Stash Files (Fallback):**
- **Pattern**: `carry-overs/stashed-*.txt` 
- **Contents**: Documentation only (no files preserved)
- **Note**: Present as secondary options if no directories found
**Directory Validation:**
- Must contain `_stash-context.md` file
- Must have at least one preserved file (not just documentation)
- Skip directories older than 60 days unless explicitly requested
- Ignore incomplete or corrupted stash directories
**Conflict Detection & Safety Rules:**
- **CRITICAL**: Never overwrite files with newer last-modified dates
- **Compare timestamps**: Stash file vs current working file
- **Identify risks**: Files modified after stash creation
- **Block dangerous operations**: Default to safe cancellation
- **Provide alternatives**: Backup, selective restore, or detailed diff analysis
**Conflict Detection via Python Tool:**

The Python stash manager automatically handles cross-platform timestamp comparison using Python's `pathlib.Path.stat()` for consistent behavior across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Technical Implementation

### Python Stash Manager Commands

**MANDATORY PYTHON SCRIPT USAGE:**
**List Available Stashes (REQUIRED):**

```bash

python tools/stash_manager.py list

```

**Check for Conflicts (REQUIRED):**

```bash

python tools/stash_manager.py conflicts <stash-name>

```

**Restore Stash (REQUIRED):**

```bash

python tools/stash_manager.py restore <stash-name>

```

**Restore with Backup (REQUIRED):**

```bash

python tools/stash_manager.py restore <stash-name> --backup

```

**❌ DO NOT USE:**
- Manual directory scanning (`list_dir`, `ls`, `Get-ChildItem`)
- Manual file operations (`copy`, `cp`, `Copy-Item`)
- Manual timestamp comparison
- Manual context file reading

### Workflow Process

**0. Pre-Restoration Git Check** - Always check for uncommitted changes first:

```bash

# Double-check git status before any stash operations (prevents false clean status)

git status --porcelain

git status --short

```

**If uncommitted changes detected:**
- Present user with commit options
- Offer to launch OLAF commit thread: `olaf propose commit thread`
- Wait for user decision and potential commit completion
- Recheck git status after commits (if executed)
- Proceed only when user confirms readiness
**1. List Stashes (MANDATORY PYTHON SCRIPT)** - Show numbered options to user:

```bash

python tools/stash_manager.py list

```

**2. Check Selected Stash (MANDATORY PYTHON SCRIPT)** - Detect conflicts before restoration:

```bash  

python tools/stash_manager.py conflicts <stash-name>

```

**3. Handle Conflicts** - Present options based on conflict check:
- ✅ **No conflicts**: Proceed with safe restoration
- ⚠️ **Conflicts detected**: Present user options:
- 🛑 Cancel restoration (recommended)
- 📁 Backup current files first (`--backup`)  
- ⚡ Force overwrite (`--force`, dangerous)
**4. Execute Restoration** - Run appropriate restore command:

```bash

# Safe restore (no conflicts)

python tools/stash_manager.py restore <stash-name>

# With backup (conflicts handled)  

python tools/stash_manager.py restore <stash-name> --backup

# Force restore (user accepts risk)

python tools/stash_manager.py restore <stash-name> --force

```
