## Step 9: Level 2 Validation

### 9.1 Level 2 Validation Checklist

**✅ Level 2 Should Show:**
- [ ] **Implementation details** (algorithms, specific operations)
- [ ] **Error handling** and exception paths
- [ ] **Internal data stores** (temporary, cache, working data)
- [ ] **Decision logic** and control flows
- [ ] **Technical processes** (validation, transformation, formatting)
- [ ] **Sub-functions** of the parent Level 1 process

**✅ Level 2 Quality Checks:**
- [ ] **Completeness:** All inputs/outputs of parent process are accounted for
- [ ] **Consistency:** Data flows balance (inputs = processing + outputs)
- [ ] **Connectivity:** All sub-processes connect through data flows
- [ ] **Boundary:** Only shows internals of the parent process
- [ ] **Detail Level:** Shows "how" the parent process works

**❌ Level 2 Problems to Fix:**
- [ ] **Missing connections:** Sub-processes without proper data flows
- [ ] **Scope creep:** Showing processes outside the parent scope
- [ ] **Insufficient detail:** Still too high-level for Level 2
- [ ] **Over-decomposition:** Too many trivial sub-processes

### 9.2 Level 2 Validation Questions

1. **Completeness Check:** Does the Level 2 account for all functionality of the parent Level 1 process?
   - Verify all inputs from Level 1 are processed
   - Verify all outputs to Level 1 are generated
   - Check for missing error handling

2. **Boundary Check:** Does the Level 2 stay within the scope of its parent process?
   - No interactions with other Level 1 processes
   - No external entities (they stay at Level 1)
   - No data stores shared with other Level 1 processes

3. **Detail Level Check:** Does the Level 2 show appropriate implementation detail?
   - Technical algorithms and logic
   - Internal decision points
   - Error handling mechanisms

4. **Consistency Check:** Do the data flows make sense technically?
   - Data transformations are logical
   - Error conditions are handled
   - No data appears or disappears unexpectedly

### 9.3 Level 2 Refinement (if needed)

**If validation identifies issues:**

**Add Missing Sub-Processes:**
- Identify gaps in the process flow
- Add error handling sub-processes
- Include validation and verification steps

**Fix Boundary Issues:**
- Remove external interactions (keep at Level 1)
- Focus only on internal implementation
- Consolidate scattered functionality

**Adjust Detail Level:**
- Add technical implementation details
- Include specific algorithms and logic
- Show internal data transformations

### 9.4 Document Validation Results

**Add validation results to master progress:**
```markdown
### Level 2 Validation Results:
- **Processes Decomposed:** [List of Level 1 processes with Level 2]
- **Sub-Process Count:** [Total number across all Level 2 diagrams]
- **Completeness:** [Complete/Issues Identified]
