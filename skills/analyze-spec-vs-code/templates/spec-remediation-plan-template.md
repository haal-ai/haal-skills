# Phase 3: Remediation Plan — Align Code to Spec

Date: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>
Reference: Phase 1 Gap Analysis: <path>
Reference: Phase 2 Impact Analysis: <path>

## Objectives
- Close gaps between EARS spec and code
- Mitigate divergences and risks
- Provide a sequenced, testable plan

## Plan Overview
- Strategy: <e.g., incremental fixes by domain, or capability-driven>
- Scope: <requirements included>
- Constraints: <time, resources, releases>

## Work Breakdown

### Workstream A — <Capability/Domain>
- Tasks
  1. <Task> — Owner: <name> — ETA: <date> — Dependencies: <task/ref>
  2. <Task>
- Deliverables
  - <artifact or PR>
- Acceptance
  - <tests to pass, criteria>

### Workstream B — <Capability/Domain>
- Tasks
  1. <Task>
- Deliverables
  - <artifact or PR>

  - <criteria>

## Risk Management
- Risk: <description> — Mitigation: <action> — Contingency: <fallback>

## Communication & Checkpoints
- Weekly checkpoint: <agenda, metrics>
- Artifacts: traceability matrix, impact logs, test reports

## Definition of Done
- All gaps closed or deferred with decision and timeline
- All impacted tests updated/passing (ATs/VCs)
- Documentation updated (spec Step 2 refresh if needed)
