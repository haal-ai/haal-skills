# How to Use Validate Prompt Value

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Prerequisites
- Have a prompt ready for validation (file, text, or name)
- Understand your intended use case for the prompt
- Know what validation scope you need

### Step 1: Invoke the Skill
Use any of these commands:
- `validate prompt value`
- `assess prompt value` 
- `evaluate prompt effectiveness`
- `prompt quality check`

### Step 2: Provide Required Parameters
The skill will request:
- **Prompt source**: File path, copy-paste text, or prompt name
- **Validation scope**: Choose from:
  - `effectiveness` - Focus on prompt clarity and instruction quality
  - `business-value` - Assess ROI and automation potential
  - `technical-quality` - Review best practices and compliance
  - `complete` - Comprehensive evaluation across all dimensions

### Step 3: Optional Context (Recommended)
Provide additional details for better assessment:
- **Use case context**: How you plan to use the prompt
- **Success metrics**: What outcomes you expect
- **Target audience**: Who will use this prompt

### Step 4: Review Assessment Results
The skill provides:
- Quantified scores (1-10) for each validation dimension
- Detailed analysis of strengths and weaknesses
- Prioritized improvement recommendations
- Implementation effort estimates

### Step 5: Act on Recommendations
Follow the prioritized action items:
- Address critical issues first
- Implement high-impact, low-effort improvements
- Plan for complex enhancements
- Schedule follow-up validation

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pre-Deployment Check
```
Input: New automation prompt for code review
Scope: complete
Context: Team workflow integration
Result: Full assessment with deployment readiness score
```

### Scenario 2: Optimization Project
```
