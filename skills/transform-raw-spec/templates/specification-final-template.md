# [Spec Name] - Final EARS Specification

**Document Purpose**: Consolidated EARS specification for design phase (ESDI Phase 3)  
**Generated**: [Date]  
**Source Steps**: step1-step7 analysis and refinement  
**Status**: Final - Ready for generate-design consumption

---

## Document Overview

This specification consolidates:
- ✅ EARS requirements from Step 2 (with all refinements)
- ✅ Decisions and clarifications from Steps 3-5
- ✅ Visual documentation from Step 6
- ✅ Testability framework from Step 7

**Traceability**:
- Raw input: `[path to raw rules/spec]`
- Step files: `[output_folder]/step*.md`
- Latest EARS: `step2-[timestamp].md` (integrated below)
