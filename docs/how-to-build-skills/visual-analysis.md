# Visual Analysis

When inputs can be rendered as images, have the agent analyze them visually.

## Example: Architecture Diagram Analysis

```markdown
## Architecture diagram analysis

1. Convert diagram to image:
   ```bash
   python scripts/render_diagram.py architecture.puml
   ```

2. Analyze the image to identify component relationships
3. The agent can see dependencies and coupling visually
```

In this example, you'd need to write the `render_diagram.py` script.
The agent's vision capabilities help understand layouts and structures.
