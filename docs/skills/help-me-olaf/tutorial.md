# OLAF Help: Step-by-Step Tutorial

**How to Execute the "OLAF Help" Workflow**

This tutorial shows how to discover available OLAF competencies and get help.

## Prerequisites

- Active OLAF session
- Basic understanding that OLAF has multiple competencies

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Invoke Help
Request help from OLAF

**User Action:**
1. Type one of these commands:
   - `help me`
   - `olaf help`
   - `olaf i need you`

**OLAF Response:**
OLAF will begin the help discovery process

### Step 2: Specify Your Need (Optional)
**User Action:** Describe what you need help with
```
I need help with code review
```

**Or ask general questions:**
- "What can you do?"
- "Show me all competencies"
- "What competencies are available for developers?"

### Step 3: Competency Discovery
**What OLAF Does:**
- Searches available competencies
- Filters by relevance to your request
- Organizes by category or persona
- Provides descriptions and use cases

**You Should See:** List of relevant competencies with descriptions

### Step 4: Learn About Competencies
**What OLAF Provides:**
- Competency names and commands
- Brief descriptions of what each does
- When to use each competency
- Related competencies

**You Should See:** Organized list with actionable information

### Step 5: Execute or Learn More
**User Action:** Choose next step
- Execute a competency directly: "use code review competency"
- Ask for more details: "tell me more about the architect competency"
- Browse by category: "show me all developer competencies"

## Verification Checklist

✅ **Relevant competencies are listed**
✅ **Descriptions are clear and actionable**
✅ **Commands are provided for each competency**
✅ **You understand which competency to use**

## Troubleshooting

**If too many results:**
- Be more specific: "help with database design"
- Filter by persona: "show developer competencies"
- Ask for top recommendations: "what's the best competency for my situation?"

**If no relevant results:**
- Try broader terms: "help with development" instead of specific tech
- Ask what's available: "what categories of competencies exist?"
- Use `use competency` for intelligent routing

**If you're not sure which to use:**
- Describe your goal: "I want to improve code quality"
- OLAF will recommend the most appropriate competency
- Ask for comparisons: "what's the difference between X and Y?"

## Key Learning Points

1. **Multiple Entry Points**: Several commands trigger help (help me, olaf help, etc.)
2. **Smart Discovery**: Can search by keywords, persona, or category
3. **Actionable Results**: Provides commands to execute competencies
4. **Contextual Help**: Tailors results to your specific needs

## Next Steps to Try

- Execute a discovered competency
- Use `use competency` for intelligent routing to the right competency
- Explore competencies by persona (developer, architect, etc.)
- Bookmark frequently used competencies

## Expected Timeline

- **Total help time:** 1-2 minutes
- **User input required:** Command and optional description (30 seconds)
- **OLAF execution time:** Search and display results (30-60 seconds)
