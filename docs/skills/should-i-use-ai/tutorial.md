# Should I Use AI?: Step-by-Step Tutorial

**How to Execute the "Should I Use AI?" Workflow**

This tutorial shows how to evaluate whether AI is appropriate for your task or problem.

## Prerequisites

- Clear description of the task or problem
- Understanding of current approach (if applicable)
- Basic context about constraints and requirements

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Invoke the Competency
Start the AI appropriateness evaluation

**User Action:**
1. Type the command: `should i use ai`
2. Describe the task you're considering AI for

**OLAF Response:**
OLAF will begin the appropriateness analysis

### Step 2: Provide Task Details
**User Action:** Describe your task or problem
```
I want to use AI to automatically generate code documentation from source code comments
```

**Provide Context:**
- **Current Approach**: Manual documentation writing
- **Data Available**: Large codebase with comments
- **Goal**: Save developer time on documentation

### Step 3: Problem Analysis
**What OLAF Does:**
- Analyzes task characteristics
- Evaluates if AI is suitable
- Considers data requirements
- Identifies potential approaches
- Assesses complexity vs benefit

**You Should See:** Analysis of problem characteristics

### Step 4: Appropriateness Assessment
**What OLAF Provides:**
- Clear recommendation (yes/no/maybe)
- Reasoning for the recommendation
- Alternative approaches to consider
- Risks and limitations
- Implementation considerations

**You Should See:** Structured assessment with recommendation

### Step 5: Review and Decide
**User Action:** Use the assessment
- Review the reasoning
- Consider alternatives mentioned
- Evaluate risks and benefits
- Ask follow-up questions if needed
- Make informed decision

## Verification Checklist

✅ **Clear recommendation provided (yes/no/maybe)**
✅ **Reasoning is specific to your task**
✅ **Alternatives are considered**
✅ **Risks and limitations are identified**
✅ **You understand the recommendation**

## Troubleshooting

**If recommendation is unclear:**
- Provide more context about your specific situation
- Ask for clarification: "why is AI appropriate/inappropriate here?"
- Request comparison: "how does this compare to rule-based approach?"

**If you disagree with assessment:**
- Share your reasoning and ask for reconsideration
- Provide additional context that might change the analysis
- Ask about specific concerns: "what if we have more data?"

**If you need deeper analysis:**
- Use `assess genai initiative` for comprehensive evaluation
- Ask for specific aspects: "what about the data requirements?"

## Key Learning Points

1. **Structured Evaluation**: Systematic approach to AI appropriateness
2. **Alternatives Considered**: Not every problem needs AI
3. **Risk-Aware**: Highlights potential issues early
4. **Actionable**: Provides clear recommendation with reasoning

## Next Steps to Try

- If yes: Use `assess genai initiative` for detailed planning
- If no: Explore suggested alternatives
- If maybe: Gather more information or run pilot
- Find experts: Use `find expert contact` for AI expertise

## Expected Timeline

- **Total evaluation time:** 2-3 minutes
- **User input required:** Task description (1 minute)
- **OLAF execution time:** Analysis and recommendation (1-2 minutes)
