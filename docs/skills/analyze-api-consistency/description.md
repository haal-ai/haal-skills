# Analyze API Consistency (Code-Mapper Skill)

This skill runs full code-mapper foundation analysis on a target repository and generates an API consistency report for selected modules/packages. It uses the code-map output to extract complete public API signatures and analyzes naming, parameter, and return-pattern consistency, producing a structured report following `templates/api-consistency-analysis-structure.md`.
