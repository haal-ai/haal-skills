# Lean and Search Skill: Step-by-Step Tutorial

## Overview
The lean-and-search skill helps you systematically discover information and acquire knowledge through structured research workflows. This tutorial guides you through using this skill effectively for focused learning objectives.

## When to Use This Skill
- You need to quickly learn something new for a specific purpose
- You want to research a topic with structured documentation
- You need credible sources with proper citations
- You want to validate learning through practical application
- You need to identify knowledge gaps for future learning

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with research concepts
- Access to web search capabilities
- Ability to evaluate source credibility

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Learning Parameters
Before invoking the skill, prepare three key inputs:

1. **Learning Objective**: Be specific about what you want to learn
   - ❌ "Learn about AI"
   - ✅ "Understand how to implement basic neural networks in Python for image classification"

2. **Current Knowledge**: Assess your starting point honestly
   - Example: "I know Python basics and some machine learning concepts, but never implemented neural networks"

3. **Context**: Define the practical application and constraints
   - Example: "Need to build a prototype for work presentation next week, using TensorFlow or PyTorch"

### Step 2: Invoke the Skill
Use the lean-and-search skill with your prepared parameters:

```
olaf lean-and-search
```

The system will prompt you for the three parameters if not provided.

### Step 3: Review the Learning Process
The skill will guide you through:

1. **Goal Definition**: Clarifying specific objectives
2. **Search Strategy**: Planning information sources
3. **Systematic Search**: Finding and documenting sources
4. **Information Synthesis**: Evaluating and connecting findings
5. **Practical Application**: Testing understanding
6. **Report Generation**: Creating structured documentation

### Step 4: Validate Outputs
Ensure your learning report includes:

- [ ] Clear learning summary with key concepts
- [ ] Credible sources with full URLs
- [ ] Practical examples you can implement
- [ ] Identified knowledge gaps
- [ ] Actionable next steps
- [ ] Learning validation exercises

## Best Practices

### Effective Learning Objectives
- Be specific and measurable
- Include practical application context
- Set realistic scope boundaries
- Consider time constraints

### Source Quality Guidelines
- Prioritize official documentation
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Note publication dates and relevance
- Verify URLs are accessible
- Document author credentials when relevant

### Application Focus
- Always seek practical examples
- Test understanding through exercises
- Connect new knowledge to existing skills
- Identify real-world use cases

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Vague Objectives**: Starting without clear learning goals
2. **Poor Sources**: Accepting information without URL verification
3. **No Validation**: Skipping practical application tests
4. **Isolated Learning**: Not connecting to existing knowledge
5. **Incomplete Documentation**: Missing key sections in reports

## Example Session

### Input Parameters
- **Learning Objective**: "Learn how to optimize PostgreSQL query performance for large datasets"
- **Current Knowledge**: "I know basic SQL queries and database concepts, but new to performance optimization"
- **Context**: "Working on e-commerce application with slow product search queries, need solution within 2 weeks"

### Expected Output Structure
```
# Lean and Search Report: PostgreSQL Query Optimization

**Generated**: 20251119-1445 UTC
**Learning Objective**: Learn how to optimize PostgreSQL query performance for large datasets
**Current Knowledge Level**: Basic SQL and database concepts
**Context**: E-commerce application performance improvement

## Learning Summary
### Key Concepts Discovered
1. **Index Strategy**: Different index types and selection criteria
2. **Query Analysis**: Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE for performance insights
3. **Configuration Tuning**: Key PostgreSQL settings for performance

### Main Insights
- Index selection affects query performance more than configuration tuning
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE reveals actual bottlenecks vs assumptions
- Connection pooling essential for high-concurrency applications

## Source Documentation
[Detailed sources with URLs and quality ratings]

## Application Examples
[Practical query optimization examples with code]

## Knowledge Gaps
[Areas requiring deeper research]

## Next Steps
[Immediate actions and learning plan]
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### Complementary Skills
- **review-code**: Validate implementation of learned concepts
- **generate-tech-spec**: Document technical solutions from research
- **create-prompt**: Share research methodology as reusable prompts

### Workflow Combinations
1. **Research → Implement → Review**
   - Use lean-and-search for research
   - Implement learning in code
   - Use review skills for validation

2. **Learn → Document → Share**
   - Research with lean-and-search
   - Create documentation with generate-tech-spec
   - Share knowledge with create-prompt

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No sources found"
- **Cause**: Overly specific or poorly formatted search terms
- **Solution**: Broaden search scope, use alternative terminology

### Issue: "Conflicting information"
- **Cause**: Different source perspectives or outdated information
- **Solution**: Document conflicts, prioritize authoritative sources, note date relevance

### Issue: "Can't validate learning"
- **Cause**: Lack of practical application opportunities
- **Solution**: Create simplified test scenarios, use online sandboxes

### Issue: "Report too long/complex"
- **Cause**: Scope creep during research
- **Solution**: Return to original learning objective, split into multiple sessions

## Advanced Usage

### Research Iterations
For complex topics, use iterative approach:
1. Initial broad research with lean-and-search
2. Identify specific gaps or areas of interest
3. Focused follow-up sessions on specific subtopics

### Source Management
- Maintain bibliography of high-quality sources
- Create rating system for source credibility
- Track source updates and revisit periodically

### Knowledge Building
- Link reports to build knowledge network
- Create glossaries for technical terms
- Develop personal learning templates

## Conclusion

The lean-and-search skill provides structured methodology for efficient learning and knowledge acquisition. Focus on specific objectives, validate understanding through application, and maintain high-quality documentation for future reference.
