# Skill: Plan DB API Remediation

This skill translates a DB↔API fit analysis into a decision-driven delivery impact summary and (when needed) a phased remediation plan.

It is intended to be used after `analyze-db-api-fit`, when mismatches are known but stakeholders need a clear decision path based on delivery constraints and impact to existing users.
